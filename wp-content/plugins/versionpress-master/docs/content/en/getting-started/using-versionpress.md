# Using VersionPress

VersionPress is used in three main ways:

## Auto-tracking (unattended mode)

You can activate VersionPress and forget it. It will work behind the scenes, automatically tracking changes on the site. Learn more in the [change tracking](../feature-focus/change-tracking.md) topic.

## Inspecting history of changes

On the VersionPress admin screen, you can inspect the history of changes:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26038386/9ea8e4b4-3907-11e7-9eea-5393c6f0a300.png" alt="History overview" />
</figure>

Each row is clickable and will reveal more details about the change:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26038391/b496372c-3907-11e7-875c-460c4b7fcae3.png" alt="Change detail" />
</figure>

You can also switch to the *Full diff* mode which displays complete contents of the change:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26038396/c7cab840-3907-11e7-84e8-012f15159111.png" alt="Full diff view" />
</figure>

## Undoing changes

When something goes wrong, you can use the [Undo and Rollback feature](../feature-focus/undo-and-rollback.md) to return to a previous state of a site or to revert a specific change.
